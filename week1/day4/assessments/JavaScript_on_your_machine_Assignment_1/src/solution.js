  The `faker` package has already been installed. 
  
  Require the `faker` package at the top of this file.  Make sure to assign it to a variable named `faker`.
  
  Use the `faker` package inside of the plantGenerator() function.
  
  For the name property, return a string value using any method from `faker` that you want. 
  
  For the color property, return a string value using one of the available color methods from `faker`

  plantGenerator should return a different `name` and `color` combination each time it is called.
  
  Finally, export plantGenerator as a function.
